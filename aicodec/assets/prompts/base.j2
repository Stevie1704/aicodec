{% if code_context %}
<code_context>
The relevant codebase is provided below as a JSON array. Each object in the array contains the relative 'filePath' and the full 'content' of a file.

```json
{{ code_context }}
```
</code_context>

{% if include_output_instructions %}
<output_instructions>
Your response MUST be a single, raw JSON object that is valid RFC 8259 JSON.
Do **not** include any conversational text, explanations, code fences, markdown, comments, or extra formatting before or after the JSON object.
{% block output_instructions_body %}
The JSON object must strictly adhere to the following rules and schema:
1. **Summary**: Provide a brief, human-readable summary of the proposed changes in the `summary` field.
2. **File Modifications**: List all file modifications in the `changes` array.
3. **Action Types**:
   * Use `CREATE` for new files.
   * Use `REPLACE` to replace the entire content of an existing file.
   * Use `DELETE` to remove files.
4. **Full Content**:
   * For `CREATE` and `REPLACE` actions, the `content` field must contain the **entire** new content of the file, not just a diff or snippet.
   * For text files, include literal text properly escaped for JSON.
5. **Deletion**: For `DELETE` actions, set the `content` field to an empty string and omit `encoding`.
6. **File Paths**: Use the exact relative `filePath` values as provided in the code context. Use POSIX-style paths (e.g. `src/app.py`) with no leading `./`.
7. **Output Validity**: The JSON must parse without errors, contain no trailing commas, and use straight double quotes only.

**JSON Schema:**
```json
{{ json_schema }}
